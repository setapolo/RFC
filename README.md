# PapaMama Coding

PapaMama coding style is a minimalistic one-liner JavaScript library that enables you to create a simple domain-specific language (DSL) using the concept of shells (like seashells). You can combine features in units called "crums(clams)" (the inside of the shell or scrap things).

```javascript
const RFC = (m, F) => (...R) => F = (...c) => R[0](c, R, m) ? F : RFC(m);
```

State management: The RFC(Recursive Function Combinator) function takes an initial state m as its first argument. This state can be an object or any other data type that you want to manage throughout the execution of the composed functions.

Function composition: The second argument F is a placeholder for the composed functions, which are supplied later as "Crums" through the returned function. The RFC function returns a new function that takes any number of "Crum" as its arguments, represented by the rest parameter ...R.

Function execution: The returned function creates a new function F that takes a "Crum" as its argument, represented by the rest parameter ...c. This F function is then responsible for executing the "Crum" function and managing the state. If the "Crum" function returns true, the F function is returned; otherwise, the RFC function is called again with the updated state m.

This coding style allows for concise and flexible code, as well as a unique way of managing state and composing functionality in a single line.
